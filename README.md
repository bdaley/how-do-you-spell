# How do you spell...

> A simple Nuxt PWA to convert speech to text

## About 
My kids are constantly asking me how to spell words because (as of creation) Google Home spells too quickly. I whipped up this PWA so they could run the app on any web-enabled device with a microphone.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
